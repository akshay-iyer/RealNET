# RealNET
Internet of Things in everday life using Raspberry Pi

Hi All,

This project revolves around exploring the utility of Internet of Things in our daily lives using Raspberry Pi. 
IoT is something of a buzzword these days and all major corporations are in an intense competition to outdo each other in the field of IoT. But this revolutionary concept is not just for industries or major corporations but has great potential to alter our lives for the better. 

RealNET is an attempt to show the world a few ways in which IoT can be benefical for our lives. All the modules (6 in total) in RealNET have been successfully implemented and tested.
